Requests module can be used to access the desired website and Beautiful Soup module can be used to parse the HTML source code of the website. Beautiful soup makes it very easy to parse HTML content and then provides multiple methods which can be used to extract the data from any HTML tags. All the website are written in HTML language hence in order to perform web scrapping, our program needs to read the HTML content.
